            <h1>Stanford researchers find a quicker, cheaper way to sort isotopes</h2>
            <p>
                BY EMMANUEL ROMERO L.A. Cicero Richard Zare
                Professor Richard Zare in his lab. Whether it's the summer
                grass that tickles your feet or the red Bordeaux smacking on
                your palate, nearly every part of the world around you carries,
                special chemical markers. These markers, called isotopes, can
                tell scientists where the molecules that compose a substance
                are from, where they traveled and what happened to them
                along the way. But doing these analyses has been complex
                and costly. Now, Stanford chemists have developed a new
                method to make isotopic analysis easier and less expensive.

            <h1>Chance to dance: Enthusiasts fly to Stanford for dance weekend</h1>
            <p>
                BY CYNTHIA HAVEN L.A. Cicero Lindy Hop instruction
                Stanford is an epicenter for the vintage dance movementâ€”but
                life in the Stanford dance world is not all foxtrots and tangos.
                The June 26-28 Stanford's Dance Weekend in Roble Gym
                offers something for modern dance enthusiasts, too: the
                hustle, the West Coast swing, 1970s disco hustle, Bollywood
                and blues fusion.
